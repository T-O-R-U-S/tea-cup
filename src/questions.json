For example, in Bartlett’s ‘War of the Ghosts’ study, participants changed parts of the story\nwhen they retold it, showing that memories are reconstructed.\n• Not all memories are reconstructed. Research evidence shows that important personal events, such\nas our first day at school, are often accurately remembered.\n• The theory can be applied to everyday situations. It helps us understand why two different people,\nsuch as eyewitnesses, can give very different versions of the same events. Both have reconstructed\nthe events in different ways.\n• The theory is based on evidence that has higher ecological validity than memory research in which\nparticipants have to learn word lists. This is because retelling a story is a more familiar use of memory\nin everyday life than learning word lists.\n• The theory is still very popular despite being developed in the early 1900s.\nCredit other relevant evaluation.\nNOTE: No credit for evaluation of the ‘War of the Ghosts’ study alone, without reference to how it\nimpacts on the theory"
